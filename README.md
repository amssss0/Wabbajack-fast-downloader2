### How to Use (Updated Process)

1.  **Extract Mod List:**
    *   First, use the `"Extract"` button within the tool to process your Wabbajack mod list file (`.wabbajack`).

2.  **Enter Session ID:**
    *   You need to provide your `nexusmods_session` value in the `"YOUR NEXUS SESSIONID"` field.
    *   **Watch the Video:** Detailed instructions on how to find this value are in the video located in the `docs` folder provided with the tool.
    *   **One-Time Setup (Usually):** You typically only need to do this once. However, you **must** re-enter it if you log out of Nexus Mods, or if you log into your Nexus Mods account on a different device or browser.

3.  **ðŸ”’ NEVER Share Your Session ID:**
    *   Your `nexusmods_session` value is sensitive authentication data. Keep it private and secure. Sharing it compromises your Nexus Mods account.

4.  **Set Download Location:**
    *   Specify the folder where you want the mods to be downloaded.

5.  **Start Download:**
    *   Click the `"Download Batch"` button to begin.

**Wabbajack Fast Downloader** is a tool designed to streamline the process of downloading mods for modlists generated by Wabbajack. It extracts mod IDs and file IDs from the Wabbajack modlist JSON file, generates download links, and opens these links in batches for efficient downloading.

> **Project Origin:** This project was inspired by the need for a faster mod downloading process for Wabbajack-generated modlists, originating from [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/issues/17).

## How It Works

1. **Modlist Extraction:** Parses the JSON modlist file to extract mod IDs and file IDs, generating download links for each mod on Nexus Mods.
2. **Batch Download:** Opens the generated download links in batches using the `webbrowser` module to bypass download limits and speed up the process.


## Requirements

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)
- [Tampermonkey plugin to remove Nexus Mods wait time](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/394039-nexus-no-wait)
