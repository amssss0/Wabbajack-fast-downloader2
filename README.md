### How to Use (Updated Process)

1.  **Extract Mod List:**
    *   First, use the `"Extract"` button within the tool to process your Wabbajack mod list file (`.wabbajack`). This will create a output.csv listing all the mods. You only need to do this once.

2.  **Enter Session ID:**
    *   You need to provide your `nexusmods_session` value in the `"YOUR NEXUS SESSIONID"` field.
    *   **Watch the Video:** Detailed instructions on how to find this value are in the video located in the `docs` folder provided with the tool.
    *   **One-Time Setup (Usually):** You typically only need to do this once. However, you **must** re-enter it if you log out of Nexus Mods, or if you log into your Nexus Mods account on a different device or browser.

3.  **ðŸ”’ NEVER Share Your Session ID:**
    *   Your `nexusmods_session` value is sensitive authentication data. Keep it private and secure. Sharing it compromises your Nexus Mods account.

4.  **Set Download Location:**
    *   Specify the folder where you want the mods to be downloaded.

5.  **Start Download:**
    *   Click the `"Download Batch"` button to begin.
